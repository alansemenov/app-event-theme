Current thinking is that your nerves are actually responsible. The muscle performing this type of activity gets microscopic damage, not intense enough to cause pain right away. The repair process of this damage involves some inflamation and some immune cells so to call them the muscle produces a bunch of signal chemicals and molecules that initiate repair. This also makes the neurons that innervate the muscle to become more sensitive to movement (it changes how they make the molecules that are sensitive to movement in the muscle), but this does not happen that fast, (it takes time to make new proteins), thus you are not sore right away because it’s not the neurons sensing damage but them becoming more sensitive to movement. This makes you move your muscle a bit less so that it can heal. (Notice how in delayed onset muscle soreness it does not hurt right after a workout and it’s not really sore all the time, it just hurts when you move the affected muscle and usually a day later)</p>\n"}]}]},{"set":[{"name":"question","type":"String","values":[{"v":"Why is that if you fall asleep hungry you still wake up feeling bad?"}]},{"name":"answer","type":"String","values":[{"v":"<p>While you are asleep your body works to keep you alive and homeostasis up.</p>\n\n<p>Your blood sugar levels are tightly controlled, when it drops you start producing hormones to tell you that you are hungry and hormones to break down it's sugar and fat reserves to keep you alive.</p>\n\n<p>While you are asleep it's mostly growth hormone and cortisol that start lipolysis (fat breakdown)</p>\n"}]}]},{"set":[{"name":"question","type":"String","values":[{"v":"How do ski jumpers not sustain injury when landing?"}]},{"name":"answer","type":"String","values":[{"v":"<p>The direction they fall after their jump is similar to the direction of the slope they hit.
